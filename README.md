The project aims to detect and classify different types of trash items using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to categorize the trash items into six classes: plastic, glass, metal, paper, cardboard, and trash.

Deep learning algorithms are utilized to analyze and interpret images of trash items, enabling accurate classification. The project utilizes the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The CNN model consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers, which extract meaningful features from the images and make predictions based on them.

The project includes data preparation steps, such as loading and preprocessing the image dataset. The dataset comprises labeled images of various trash items, representing each of the six classes. The images are resized, normalized, and shuffled for training and evaluation purposes.

During training, the model is trained on the prepared dataset using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Model checkpoints and early stopping techniques are employed to save the best model weights and prevent overfitting. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and loss metrics.

The trained model is then used for trash detection and classification. Given an input image, the model predicts the class label of the trash item with a corresponding confidence score. The predicted class label is displayed along with the image, providing users with information about the detected trash item.

The project also includes the visualization of training and validation accuracy and loss through plots, allowing for performance analysis and model improvement. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to assess the model's classification performance across different classes.

Overall, this project showcases the application of deep learning techniques to automate the process of trash detection and classification. By utilizing a trained CNN model, the project offers a solution for efficient waste management practices. The classification results can aid in proper waste disposal and recycling efforts.
